Notes:
    1. Most of my project's code is in the "midterm_project.ipynb" file.
    2. The date dimension is created by running the "dim_date_sql.sql" file. I wasn't able to write this into the python notebook, so it has to be run separately from the notebook. A note is included in the notebook on when to run this file.
    3. I stored the "film.json" file in MongoDB to use in this project. For your reference, "film.json" can be found under "data/MongoDB".
    4. The database I am using for this project is "sakila". I've attached the MySQL Workbench Model file for this database under the "data" directory. You can also find the sql scripts to set up the database under "data/sakila_set_up".
